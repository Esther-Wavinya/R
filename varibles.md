# Variable assignment
A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called `a variable`.

A variable allows you to store `a value (e.g. 4)` or `an object` (e.g. a function description) in R.

You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.

You can assign `a value 4` to a `variable my_var` with the command

```
my_var <- 4
```

# Instructions
Over to you: complete the code in the editor such that it assigns the `value 42` to the `variable x` in the editor. Submit the answer. Notice that when you ask `R` to `print x`, the value `42` appears.

```
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42

# Print out the value of the variable x
x
```

Suppose you have a fruit basket with `five` apples. As a data analyst in training, you want to store the number of apples in a variable with the name `my_apples`.

# Instructions
Type the following code in the editor: `my_apples <- 5`. This will assign the value `5 to my_apples`.

Type: `my_apples` below the second comment. This will print out the `value of my_apples`.

Submit your answer, and look at the output: you see that the number 5 is printed. So `R` now links the `variable my_apples` to the `value 5`.

```
# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5

# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
```
