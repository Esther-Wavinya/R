# Create a vector
Feeling lucky? You better, because this chapter takes you on a trip to the City of Sins, also known as *Statisticians Paradise!*

Thanks to R and your new data-analytical skills, you will learn how to uplift your performance at the tables and fire off your career as a professional gambler. This chapter will show how you can easily keep track of your betting progress and how you can do some simple analyses on past actions. Next stop, Vegas Babyâ€¦ VEGAS!!

Instructions

Do you still remember what you have learned in the first chapter? Assign the value `"Go!"` to the variable `vegas`. Remember: R is case sensitive!

```
# Define the variable vegas
vegas <- "Go!"
```

On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.

In R, you create a vector with the combine function `c()`. You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:

```
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
```

Once you have created these vectors in R, you can use them to do calculations.

## Instructions
Complete the code such that `boolean_vector` contains the three elements: `TRUE`, `FALSE` and `TRUE` (in that order).

```
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
